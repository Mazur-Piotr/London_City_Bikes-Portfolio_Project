# London_City_Bikes-Portfolio_Project

# Project Description:
This Python and Tableau project involves data preprocessing using Python to clean and transform raw bike-sharing data. The steps include column renaming and mapping numeric codes to descriptive values. The cleaned data is exported to an Excel file for further analysis and visualization.

In Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard featuring a calendar widget as the main filter. The dashboard includes multiple visuals such as a line chart, histograms, a map, and a heatmap, all based on previously generated data. Users can control the moving average interactively in the final dashboard.

# Key Insights:
The project yielded valuable insights into London bike users, ride trends with a focus on moving averages, and the correlation between temperature and wind speed with ride patterns.
